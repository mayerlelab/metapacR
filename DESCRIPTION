Description: metapacR is an easy-to-use R package implementing a complete workflow 
    for downstream analysis of targeted and untargeted metabolome data. 
    Metabolome results can be imported into metapacR as a numerical matrix,
    allowing integration into current analysis frameworks. Data mining of metapacR 
    datasets is enabled through integration with Metabolomics Workbench. metapacR 
    allows data inspection, normalization, univariate and multivariate analysis, 
    displaying informative visualizations.
